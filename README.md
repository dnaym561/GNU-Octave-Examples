# GNU-Octave-Examples

GNU Octave code snippets that we ([pamasol.com](https://www.pamasol.com/)) mainly use to establish, visualize and explain electrical engineering stuff that we face from time to time.

## Installation on Windows 10 64-bit operating systems

1. In order to execute Java code Octave creates a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Therefore you should install Java in a first step. Go to [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and download and install the **Windows Offline (64-bit)** installer.
