# GNU-Octave-Examples

GNU Octave code snippets that we ([pamasol.com](https://www.pamasol.com/)) mainly use to establish, visualize and explain electrical engineering stuff that we face from time to time.

> [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. Octave is comparable to [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), which is not open source.

## Installation on Windows 10 64-bit operating systems

1. In order to execute Java code Octave creates a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Therefore you should install Java in a first step. Go to [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and download and install the **Windows Offline (64-bit)** installer.

2. Got to [gnu.org/software/octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and download and install the **octave-5.x.x_x-w64-installer.exe**.

3. Make sure [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) is installed on your machine as well. Clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:pamasol/GNU-Octave-Examples.git`.
